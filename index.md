# Journal Buddy - Privacy Policy

- Journal Buddy does not send any of your journal entries, exercise data, or goals to any online service without user permission. These are all stored, by default, locally on your device.

- As part of the "Chat" feature, journal entries, exercise data, or goals may be sent to the OpenAI API, along with any chat messages you send. These are not used by OpenAI for any purposes other than enabling necessary app functionality. Data is not sent unless you, as the user, explicitly select a journal entry, exercise data, or goal to submit.

- When sending data through OpenAI, journal entries, exercise data, or goals may pass through Cloudflare web services as an intermediary. Neither us nor Cloudflare persist this data at all or use it for any purposes other than enabling necessary app functionality.

- We do not save any personally identifiable information, and any statistics collected from web services will be aggregate/total statistics.
